Level 2 - verbs
"There are seven verbs you're most likely to use on a daily basis: to be, to eat, to drink, to sleep, to stay, to travel and to walk. Lucky you: verbs in Swedish are easier than in most languages!

In English, you would say "I am, he is". Not in Swedish! "Jag är, du är, han är." Yay! Let's get to the words.
